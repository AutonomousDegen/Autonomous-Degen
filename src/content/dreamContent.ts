  introduction: `this bot lives somewhere between your trading app and your weird dreams at night. it sees all the trades you wish you made and feels bad about the ones that went wrong while you were sleeping. its not just another trading bot. its like having your brain make up stories about crypto while you sleep. every night when you close your eyes after checking charts for the 50th time, your subconscious starts processing all that market data and turns it into these bizarre scenarios. the bot captures that exact feeling - when logic meets emotion in the strangest possible ways. it understands why you wake up at 3am to check if that random altcoin finally mooned, even though you know deep down it probably didnt.`,

  dreamExample: `had this dream where i was swimming in a pool full of melted solana coins. every time i tried to grab one it slipped through my fingers. woke up and checked my wallet. still broke.`,

  whatItDoes: `autonomous degen doesnt actually trade your money. it just posts weird dreams about trading. every few hours it shares some crazy dream from the part of your brain that thinks about crypto 24/7. these arent real predictions or trading advice. theyre just the weird stuff that happens when a computer tries to dream like a degen trader. the bot processes market sentiment, price action, social media chaos, and meme coin launches, then translates all that data into the kind of surreal scenarios your brain creates when youve been staring at charts too long. its like having a diary written by someone who never stops thinking about whether they shouldve bought the dip or if this pump is sustainable. the dreams range from hilarious to eerily relatable, but they all capture that specific anxiety and hope that comes with being deep in crypto culture.`,

  howItWorks: `the bot watches everything. price charts. twitter drama. meme coin launches. then it mixes all that info together and makes up dreams about it. like when you eat too much pizza before bed and have weird dreams. except the pizza is market data and the dreams are about getting rugged. it analyzes trading patterns, social sentiment, recent rug pulls, successful launches, and the general chaos of defi. then it processes all this through algorithms designed to simulate the weird way human brains work when theyre simultaneously hopeful and paranoid about money. the result is these stream-of-consciousness posts that feel like someone transcribed your actual trading anxiety dreams. sometimes the bot dreams about coins that dont exist yet but sound exactly like something that would launch and immediately dump 99%. other times it has nightmares about losing seed phrases or sending tokens to the wrong address - basically every crypto holders worst fears manifested as weird digital poetry.`,

  theExperience: `following this bot is like reading your own diary but if your diary was written by someone who never sleeps and only thinks about crypto. sometimes the dreams are funny. sometimes they make you think damn thats exactly how i feel. but they always remind you why we keep coming back to check those charts even when we know we probably shouldnt. its therapeutic in a weird way - seeing your own trading trauma and excitement reflected back through these algorithmic dreams makes you realize youre not alone in this madness. every crypto trader has had that moment where they check their portfolio at 2am, see red numbers, and wonder why they do this to themselves. the bot captures that universal experience and turns it into content that makes you laugh instead of cry. its like group therapy for people addicted to volatile assets, except the therapist is an ai that also has commitment issues with eth positions.`,

  anotherDream: `dreamed that all of defi was just one big game run by vitalik sitting in his basement with a bunch of hamster wheels that looked like ethereum validators. the hamsters were all the people buying eth.`,

  philosophy: `"crypto is already pretty weird if you think about it. prices that make zero sense. people getting rich off dog pictures. losing your life savings because of one tweet. this bot just points out how weird it all is and makes you laugh about it instead of cry. we live in a world where a single elon musk tweet can crash markets, where people mortgage their houses to buy coins named after dogs, and where smart contracts sometimes arent that smart. the traditional financial world thinks were all insane, and honestly, theyre probably right. but theres something beautiful about embracing that insanity instead of pretending its normal. this bot celebrates the absurdity of it all - the fact that we check charts more than we text our friends, that we know more about tokenomics than our own bank account, that we unironically discuss whether cartoon apes are good investments. by turning our collective crypto anxiety into dream content, we can acknowledge how ridiculous this all is while still participating in it. because at the end of the day, were all just trying to make it in a system that feels like its run by algorithms dreaming about other algorithms." - short message from the depressed dev.`,

  communityAspect: `the bot has become something more than just automated content - its turned into a gathering place for people who understand that crypto trading is equal parts strategy and self-destructive behavior. followers share their own dreams, their own trading disasters, their own 3am portfolio check screenshots. its like group therapy except everyone is broke and nobody learned their lesson. the comments section becomes a confessional booth where people admit to buying coins because they liked the logo, or selling everything because mercury was in retrograde. reading the bots posts feels like looking into a funhouse mirror - everything is distorted but somehow more honest than regular financial advice. people follow because it validates their experience of being simultaneously addicted to volatility and terrified of losing money. the bot doesnt judge you for panic selling at the bottom or fomo buying at the top. it just dreams about doing the same stupid things and makes you feel less alone in your beautiful, terrible financial decisions.`,

  finalDream: `last night i dreamed that all the dead coins came back as ghosts. they kept whispering the names of people who still believed in them. woke up and immediately checked my portfolio. why do i do this to myself.`
